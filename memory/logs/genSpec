Open Visual Studio and create a New Project.\n2. Choose \"Console Application\" as your project type.\n3. Give your project a name and select a location to store the project.\n4. Once your project is created, Visual Studio automatically creates a Program.cs file for you with some basic code.\n\nReplace the auto-generated code inside the Program.cs with following C# code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet's break down this code:\n\n- The `using System;` line includes the system namespace in your program, which allows the program to call the `Console.WriteLine()` method.\n\n- The `namespace HelloWorld` line creates a new namespace called `HelloWorld`.\n\n- Inside this namespace, a `Program` class is defined.\n\n- Inside the `Program` class, the `Main` method is defined. This is the application entry point. The `Main` function is the first method that is run in your program.\n\n- Inside `Main()`, the `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");` line sends the text `\"Hello, World!\"` to the standard output, which is usually the command prompt or terminal.\n\nTo run your code, \n\n1. Press `Ctrl+F5` to compile and run your project. \n2. A console window will appear that prints out `\"Hello, World!\"`.\n\nThat's it! You've just created your first \"Hello, World!\" console application in C#."}]
