Visual Studio includes a unit testing framework called MSTest, but other frameworks like NUnit or xUnit can be used as well. \n\nBelow is an example of a Unit Test for the 'Hello, World!' console application using MSTest:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;\nusing HelloWorld;\nusing System.IO;\n\nnamespace HelloWorldTests\n{\n    [TestClass]\n    public class UnitTest1\n    {\n        private string _consoleOutput;\n        \n        [TestInitialize]\n        public void Setup()\n        {\n            var output = new StringWriter();\n            Console.SetOut(output);\n        \n            Program.Main(new string[0]);\n        \n            _consoleOutput = output.ToString();\n        }\n\n        [TestMethod]\n        public void TestMethod1()\n        {\n            Assert.IsTrue(_consoleOutput.Contains(\"Hello, World!\"));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere's how this works:\n\n1. Before every test, the `SetUp` method is run. In this method, the `Console.SetOut` method is used to redirect the console output to a `StringWriter`.\n\n2. Then the `Main` method of the 'Hello, World!' application is called.\n\n3. The console output can now be accessed as a string through the `StringWriter.ToString` method, and stored in `_consoleOutput`.\n\n4. In the unit test `TestMethod1`, I check if the console output contains \"Hello, World!\". If it does, the test passes.\n\nThis is a simple example and generally, for a real world application, you would have many more unit tests testing various functionality of your code."},{"role":"assistant","content":"```bash\ndotnet restore\ndotnet build\ndotnet test\n```"}]
