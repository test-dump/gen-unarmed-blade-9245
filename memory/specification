Creating a basic "Hello, World!" console application in C# involves the following steps:

1. Open Visual Studio and create a New Project.
2. Choose "Console Application" as your project type.
3. Give your project a name and select a location to store the project.
4. Once your project is created, Visual Studio automatically creates a Program.cs file for you with some basic code.

Replace the auto-generated code inside the Program.cs with following C# code:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
```

Let's break down this code:

- The `using System;` line includes the system namespace in your program, which allows the program to call the `Console.WriteLine()` method.

- The `namespace HelloWorld` line creates a new namespace called `HelloWorld`.

- Inside this namespace, a `Program` class is defined.

- Inside the `Program` class, the `Main` method is defined. This is the application entry point. The `Main` function is the first method that is run in your program.

- Inside `Main()`, the `Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");` line sends the text `"Hello, World!"` to the standard output, which is usually the command prompt or terminal.

To run your code, 

1. Press `Ctrl+F5` to compile and run your project. 
2. A console window will appear that prints out `"Hello, World!"`.

That's it! You've just created your first "Hello, World!" console application in C#.
